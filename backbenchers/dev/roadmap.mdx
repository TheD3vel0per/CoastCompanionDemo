The Gantt chart (embeded above) provides a visual representation of our project plan outlining the critical path across distinct phases. As described in our project plan, we have meticulously divided our timeline into key stages: Initiation, Requirements, Beta Implementation, Pilot, Final Implementation, and ultimately Project Completion. Each stage corresponds to specific activities and milestones critical for project progression. The Gantt chart serves as a roadmap of our critical path illustrating sequences and timeline of tasks within each phase. Each team/individual responsible for the tasks in Gantt chart below are listed in the [Responsibility Table](#responsibility-table).

### Initiation

*January 15, 2024 - January 28, 2024*

The initiation stage of our critical path is the first stage that sets the groundwork for our project's journey. Firstly, the *Local Development Environment Setup* involves configuring individual computers to ensure all developers have a working and consistent development environment. We also lay the foundation for our cloud infrastructure using AWS that aligns with project requirements. Knowledge Acquisition is an important aspect where our teams engage in thorough research to understand the domain, technologies, and any specific nuances as well as vernacular relevant to the project. Our last stage is *Mockup Creation,* where visual representations of the project's user interface and functionalities are crafted. This not only aids in conveying design concepts but also serves as a reference for our project sponsor.

### Requirements

*January 15, 2024 - February 11, 2024*

The requirements stage is a critical phase in our project development, determining what we need to build and what we need from the project sponsor. The *Sponsor Question & Answer* session serves as a pivotal opportunity for the development teams to clarify their expectations, provide insights, and address any queries raised by the project sponsor. Shortly after, the *Technical Design Modelling* phase involves crafting a detailed blueprint of the technical architecture outlining system components, interactions, and functionalities. This step lays the groundwork for a robust technical framework. Lastly, the *Data Collection* aspect involves gathering relevant data sets that will be utilized throughout the chatbot, ensuring that our solutions are informed by accurate and pertinent information. Together, these components within the requirements stage are crucial for establishing a solid foundation that will guide the subsequent phases of our project development.

### Beta Implementation

*January 25, 2024 - February 25, 2024*

After our requirements and initial project setup is complete, we begin with the *Beta Implementation* stage of our critical path. We start off with our front-end and our back-end. *Front-End Implementation* involves translating the previously created mockups into tangible user interfaces, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing design, while *Back-End Implementation* focuses on realizing the logic and functionality that supports the front-end, creating a seamless and robust user experience. We also perform any additional AWS Configuration that is needed to accommodate the evolving needs of the project. For the proper use of our chatbot, we need knowledge. This acquisition is done during the *Data Indexing* stage. After most of the implementation is complete, we commence to *End-to-End Testing,* which enables us to validate the integration and functionality of the entire system, while simultaneously doing *Unit and Integration Testing* to ensure the reliability of modular components and services.

### Pilot

*February 27, 2024 - March 31, 2024*

When the Beta is released and becomes available to the project sponsor, we begin the Pilot stage. This enables project sponsors to interact with the beta version of the Coast Companion and provide feedback to our team for modifications.

### Final Implementation

*February 27, 2024 - March 31, 2024*

The *Final Implementation* stage is where the bugs from the *Beta Implementation* are corrected, and any additional features requested by the project sponsors are added. *Front-End Modifications* and *Back-End Adjustments* ensure that user interfaces are polished and services are optimized, performant, and robust for a seamless experience. The *Additional Data Ingestion* stage will have us implement any new data requirements that have arisen from feedback supplied by the project sponsor. *QA Effort and Staging* involves rigorous testing to guarantee the reliability and stability of the entire system. *Stretch Task Implementation* addresses any additional features or enhancements identified during the development process. *Language Model Tweaking* fine-tunes our models for optimal performance.

### Project Completion

*February 27, 2024 - April 7, 2024*

The final phase of our project involves critical activities that contribute to its successful transition into project sponsor production use. *Deployment to Production Environment* is the culmination of our development efforts, where the project is released into the live environment, making it accessible to end-users. *Knowledge Transfer* is an essential step, involving the sharing of project insights, documentation, and expertise with relevant stakeholders, enabling them to effectively operate and maintain the system. Additionally, the *Warranty* stage commences, where the development team stands by to address any unforeseen issues or bugs that may arise post-deployment, ensuring we deliver reliable and trouble-free user experience.

This table complements the visual representation provided in the project's Gantt charts, offering a concise reference for team responsibilities and task assignments throughout the lifecycle of the project.


## Team Workflow

To ensure efficient and timely completion of the project, we have split up the development period into 4 Project Increments (PIs). Each increment represents a phase of the project's development and is built upon in the following increment. Incremental development would enable us to progressively build on the program’s functionality with specific expectations to meet at the end of each phase. That being said, our first PI began on January 15th, 2024. PI start and end dates can be visualized in our Gantt Chart.

### Sprints

Each of our 4 PIs would consist of 3 sprints, with each sprint spanning a week in length. Splitting phases into sprints allows us to set a period of time to focus on specific work that has to be completed by the end of the corresponding PI. Each sprint begins with a planning meeting which decides what Epics1 and User Stories2 will be tackled in it.

Furthermore, the subteams have outlined their goals for each sprint, allowing us to stay on track and meet our objectives for seamless collaboration and project delivery. By breaking down our project into smaller, more manageable chunks, we can ensure that we are making steady progress towards our final goal. Regular check-ins and status updates will help us stay on track and address any issues that may arise.

### Key Deadlines

Our project plan is based around various upcoming key deadlines. As we need to deliver the Beta version of our project by February 26th, we have set an internal “soft” deadline of February 18th for each subteam to complete their tasks related to the Beta version of the program. This deadline will allow time to be set aside for collaboration among various teams for crucial integration and end-to-end testing. After receiving feedback from the project sponsors, our final product will be delivered by April 8th.
