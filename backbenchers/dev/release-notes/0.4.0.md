## Chatbot
This release we have started to implement our chatbot settings. In this version we have added support for adjusting the font size of the messages. There are 3 font sizes you can choose according to your liking. As well, we have implemented a refresh button to allow the ability to start a new chat with the chatbot. 

**Bug Fixes:**
- Added ability to close pop up message
- Handle empty messages
- Disable chats if the chatbot is throwing errors
- Auto resizing message text box
- Removed ability to send feedback on the startup message
