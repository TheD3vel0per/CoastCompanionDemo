## Chatbot

### Minor Bug Fixes
* Font size selection persists after the user reloads the chatbot.
* The chatbot returns an error status if the rating submission was not successful. Users now have the option to resubmit feedback if the first attempt was not successful.
* Minor formatting bug fixes.

## Admin Panel
* Any modal for exporting csv file does not show proper message. For example, although the total items are 2394 rows but, Modal message shows 0 item. So, this minor error is fixed.
* Fixed broken exporting functionality expect Usage Export of Knowledge Base Usage Table
* Refactored front-end. To further explain, changed from relative path to absolute path using @ keyword. Besides, changed sources data type from string to string[] for backend side. So, need to match data type in frontend.  


## Known Issues:
- Due to un-matched data type between front-end and back-end chat history detail page and rating detail page is broken. It will be fixed soon.  
- **Source Usage Export** backend function is not fully implemented (just need to implemeted CSV formatting)
