## Refactoring

Refactoring work has been done to optimize API requests, adding more security - including the database, and building a maintainable and scalable software design before our final deliverable.

## Known Issues:

- All known bugs that have not been fixed from v0.5.1
- **Source Usage Table** is not functional due to leftover work from refactoring. This will be available soon.
