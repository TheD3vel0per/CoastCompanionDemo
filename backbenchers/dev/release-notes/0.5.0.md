## Chat Sessions Portal

Chat Sessions now displays accurate current user ratings based on each question and chat logs, as API is hooked up. All tables in Chat Sessions enable filter and sort functionality. There is a button named "Export All Chats" that refers to exporting all chats using two Date Pickers. When you export all chats using the start date and end date picker, it makes a CSV file with the naming "export_currentDateTime.csv". The functionality is fully delivered.

### Review User Rating 

API hookup is complete. Admins are now able to review responses depending on the question from a user. Admins can review the dialogue between the user and the chatbot and see a certain rating (Thumbs Up or Down). There is a button named "See more" which helps redirect to the certain chat log containing this rating. Lastly, if the rating is bad, admins can examine what kind of sources are used for answering the question.

### Review Chat History 

API hookup is complete. Admins are now able to review All Responses depending on each question from a user in a certain chat history. Admins can review the dialogue between the user and the chatbot and see a certain rating (Thumbs Up or Down). When admins hover over each response from Chat Dialog UI, the admin can notice the rating (Thumbs Up or Down), the comment, and the sources with regard to each request. Likewise, if the rating is bad, admins can examine what kind of sources are used for answering the question.
