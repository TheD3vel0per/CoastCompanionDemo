# Version 0.3.0 - Release Notes

## General Notes:

There are two logins for the admin panel.

- Username: admin | Password: Password@1
- Username: TestAdmin | Password: Testing@2


## Revamped Admin Panel UI:

We have greatly improved the style of our Admin Panel UI to make it more user-friendly. The new and improved design is focused on the feedback we recieved from the mid-term progress report, and is centred around our (Sponsor and Us) vision of a CoastCompanion admin's workflow.

### Log-in Page

The Log-in page has been reformed to be consistent with CoastCapital's UI layout design. To avoid confusion with *Coast Online Banking*, an online banking service offered by Coast Captial Savings, we have added the text "Looking for Coast Companion Online Banking?".

The page also features a login form that is a *Two-step Login Process*. It is required that the user first puts in their username, then put in their password.

### Summary Page

The Summary page has been restructured to show key statistics at the top, and 'flowing' to the bottom to show detailed analytics-ready information at the bottom. The admin user is able to quickly view the statistics of yesteraday, allowing them to quickly review the status of the ChatBot. Below the summary, there is a reports section which allows users to view and export KPIs such as (1) Session Count, (2) Average Response Time, and (3) Average Rating, aggregated over a user-selected interval. Finally, the page supports visualization for these KPIs, directly below the reports section for an intuitive user-friendly layout.

### Knowledge Base Portal

The Knowledge Base page is now a central place for CoastCompanion administrators to unleash powerful actions to configure and manage the CoastCompanion chatbot. The user is able to view active and archived sources, add sources, and view a source in detail. To include sufficient amount of control features for the admin user, we have opted for additonal pages instead of a modal. 

We have also added the feature of adding Categories to sources. The user can add, remove, assign, unassign a category from a KB source. This makes it easier for CoastCompanion admins to manage a large quantity of sources.

Additional functionalities include (1) Record keeping or *Audit Support*, and (2) Usage Reports. These are in the Knowledge Base Source Detail pages.
