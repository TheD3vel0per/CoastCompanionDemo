# Frontend Style Guide (React/TSX)

:::note[Internal Documentation]

This document is an internal documentation of **The Backbenchers**, created for the **Coast Companion** project. This document is published for supplimentary purposes only, and information listed on this document many be constantly updating and its accuracy cannot be gueranteed.

:::

The **Coast Companion Front-End React/TSX Style Guide** for is limited to large or medium scale React components like the Admin Panel. The style guide is not enforced for the Chatbot component of Coast Companion.

## Acknowledgements
The **Coast Companion React/TSX Style Guide** is heavily based on the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) and the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html). Considering the scope of this project compared to projects at Airbnb and Google, the guide may not be as thorough, and other consistent styles may have been adopted after a front-end meeting, without it being documented on this document. Many other elements of the guide that were not adopted from Airbnb and Google's guide are Coast Companion project-specific.

## Basic Rules
  - Use TypeDoc compatible comments (in-file documentation) to document every file, function, types/interfaces, modules, mutable variables, constants, hooks, etc.
    - **Why** a piece of code exists or why it was implemented in a certain way.
    - **How** to use the code, including examples if appropriate.
    - **What** the code does at a high level, especially for complex logic that isn't immediately clear from the code itself.
  - Only include one React component per file.
    - 
    - However, multiple [Stateless, or Pure, Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions) are allowed per file. eslint: [`react/no-multi-comp`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-multi-comp.md#ignorestateless).
  - Always use JSX syntax.
  - Do not use `React.createElement` unless you’re initializing the app from a file that is not JSX.
  - [`react/forbid-prop-types`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/forbid-prop-types.md) will allow `arrays` and `objects` only if it is explicitly noted what `array` and `object` contains, using `arrayOf`, `objectOf`, or `shape`.

## Functional Components over Class Components

**Components should be defined as functional components.** With the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can have states. Functional components are more intuitive, and there is nothing a functioanl component cannot do that a Class Component could do.


```tsx
interface ListingProps {
  // props for listing
}

interface ListingState {
  hello: string;
}

// bad - functional components should not use state
function Listing({ hello, state }: ListingProps) {
  return <div>{hello}</div>;
}

// good
class Listing extends React.Component<ListingProps, ListingState> {
  state: ListingState = {
    hello: "world",
  };

  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.hello}</div>;
  }
}

```

And if you don’t have state or refs, prefer normal functions (not **arrow functions**) over classes:

```tsx
// bad because there's no explicit type definition
class Rating extends React.Component<{ hello: string }> {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.hello}</div>;
  }
}

// bad (relying on function name inference is discouraged and might have implications in debugging and testing)
const Rating = ({ hello }: { hello: string }) => (
  <div>{hello}</div>
);

// good
interface ListingProps {
  hello: string;
}

function Listing({ hello }: ListingProps) {
  return <div>{hello}</div>;
}

```
