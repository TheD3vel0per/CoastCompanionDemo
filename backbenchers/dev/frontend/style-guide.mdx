# Frontend Style Guide (React/TSX)

:::note[Internal Documentation]

This document is an internal documentation of **The Backbenchers**, created for the **Coast Companion** project. This document is published for supplimentary purposes only, and information listed on this document many be constantly updating and its accuracy cannot be gueranteed.

:::

The **Coast Companion Front-End React/TSX Style Guide** for is limited to large or medium scale React components like the Admin Panel. The style guide is not enforced for the Chatbot component of Coast Companion.

## Acknowledgements
The **Coast Companion React/TSX Style Guide** is heavily based on the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/mkosir/typescript-style-guide?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) by Marko Kosir, 
[Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) and the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html). Considering the scope of this project compared to projects at Airbnb and Google, the guide may not be as thorough, and other consistent styles may have been adopted after a front-end meeting, without it being documented on this document. Many other elements of the guide that were not adopted from Airbnb and Google's guide are Coast Companion project-specific.

## Basic Rules
  - Use JSDoc, TSDoc, or TypeDoc compatible comments (in-file documentation) to document every file, function, types/interfaces, modules, mutable variables, constants, hooks, etc.
    - **Why** a piece of code exists or why it was implemented in a certain way.
    - **How** to use the code, including examples if appropriate.
    - **What** the code does at a high level, especially for complex logic that isn't immediately clear from the code itself.
  - Only include one React component per file.
    - However, for small components where it is the only use-case, include it in the bottom of the main component being exported.
    - This rule does not apply for config files or util files.
  - Always use TSX syntax. **Always** use Functional Components over Class Components.
    - With the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can have states. Functional components are more intuitive, and there is nothing a functioanl component cannot do that a Class Component could do.
  - Don't ignore ESLint.

## Naming Conventions
- lowerCamelCase for component file names and directory names
- PascalCase for functional component names
- lowerCamelCase for variable, constants, and state names
  - booleans must start with ``is`` or ``has`` prefix
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for global configuration constants

## Arrow Functions over Function Declearation
Use arrow functions (first class anonymous functions) over function declaration like ``function() {...}``. 

## Directory Structure

The directory structure follows the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) guide for project structure.

### Summary
- All features should go into the features directory
  - Features include things like pages, or things that hold multiple domains of states, or other stuff
  - The feature directories all have their own (local) component direcotry
- All components that are shared should be going into the (global) component directory
  - Components must be used by features, and they must be shraed if they are going into the shared directory

### Path Aliases
Path Aliases are defined to be used in imports. Never use relative path over absolute path aliases. They are defined as below:

```json
"paths": {
  "@shared-components/*": ["./components/*"],
  "@images/*": ["./assets/images/*"],
  "@fonts/*": ["./assets/fonts/*"],
  "@features/*": ["./features/*"],
}
```
