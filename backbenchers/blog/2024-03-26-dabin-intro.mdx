Meet **Dabin**, a driven student at the University of British Columbia, immersed in the world of Computer Science. Within the highly specialized members of The Backbenchers, he stands as the most versatile and ingenuous. As one of the group's adept full-stack engineers, Dabin's work extends across various domains, from front-end implementations to back-end functionalities.

## Dabin's Background

What sets Dabin apart is not just his technical proficiency, but his ability to navigate complex software landscapes despite being a newcomer to large-scale project development. Unlike many other members, Dabin's journey into the realm of software engineering hasn't been paved with industry internships or co-op terms. Yet, his lack of traditional experience hasn't hindered his ability to make significant contributions to the team. In fact, Dabin has made contributions consisting of the widest range of tasks we had building Coast Companion.

## Dabin's Full-Stack Role in The Backbenchers
At the heart of Dabin's role within The Backbenchers lies his keen eye for optimization and his relentless pursuit of synchronicity between frontend and backend systems. He thrives on the challenge of identifying database design enhancements, resolving bugs, and, perhaps most crucially, ensuring seamless integration between different layers of the software architecture.

In frontend development, Dabin's expertise shines brightly, particularly in his implementation of the Chat Sessions page within the Admin Panel. On the backend, Dabin's domain is the implementation of lambda functionsâ€”key components of our AWS tech stack that power the essential API interactions necessary for the Admin Panel's smooth operation.

## Dabin's Future and Goals to Success
Beyond his technical acumen, Dabin embodies the spirit of continuous growth and exploration. With an eye toward the future, he eagerly seeks opportunities to expand his horizons, including the pursuit of co-op positions to further refine his skills and broaden his industry insights.

For the upcoming summer, Dabin plans on building doing another software engineering project to refine his skills he learend from building Coast Capital with The Backbenchers.
